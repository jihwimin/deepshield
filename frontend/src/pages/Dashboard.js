          <div className="underline"></div>
          <p>
            Deepfake technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to manipulate or generate 
            hyper-realistic images, videos, and audio recordings. By leveraging machine 
            learning techniques, deepfakes can create deceptive media where individuals appear 
            to say or do things they never did. Initially developed for entertainment and AI 
            research, deepfakes have now become a tool for misinformation, fraud, and exploitation.

          <h2>Why Are More Victims Emerging?</h2>
          <p>
            Deepfakes are increasing because AI tools are widely available, making it easier than 
            ever to manipulate images and videos. Weak laws and slow regulations mean that many 
            perpetrators face no consequences, leaving victims struggling to remove harmful content. 
            Social media accelerates the spread, making it nearly impossible to control once a 
            deepfake goes viral.

          <p>
            DeepShield was created by two sisters determined to fight deepfake crimes.
            After the younger sister became a victim herself, they realized how difficult
            it was to find help and take action. Their mission is to empower victims with
            the tools, support, and community needed to reclaim control and seek justice.
